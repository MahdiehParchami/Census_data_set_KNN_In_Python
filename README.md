# Census_data_set_KNN_In_Python
Implementing K Nearest Neighbors machine learning technique on Census data set

I used a given census data set, which has been derived from the US Census and 
determines whether a person's income is above or below 50K according to some features.
I want to perform the KNN machine learning model to predict income based 
on some other features like occupation, education, gender, and race and see how accurately we can 
classify low-income from high-income citizens.
